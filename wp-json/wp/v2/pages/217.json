Compu-Links adapted to this environment and these companies purchased our data.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, our focus turned to real estate professionals who have a unique need for accurate and current public records and maps.\u00a0 To fill that need, Compu-Links wrote a desktop computer application named g.Wiz!\u00a0 The product was well received by area Realtors\u00a9. \u00a0In 2007, the internet drove\u00a0Compu-Links to adapt these desktop applications to the web and to the cloud in an SaaS model and RealtyInSite was born. Today, on Cape Cod, RealtyInSite is used by thousands of real estate professionals as a mission critical information service enabling them to do their jobs more efficiently and more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Compu-Links will continue to innovate in the area of information services for professionals. \u00a0Our focus is on the built and unbuilt property markets, aggregating public records and geospatial information with easy to use search, analysis \u00a0and reporting functions.\u00a0 We are driven\u00a0by our proven 20-year record of adapting to technology cycles and successfully delivering value to our client base.\u00a0 As a firm believer in the adage \u2018you ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet\u2019, Compu-Links looks forward to delivering to its clients the information they need to succeed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twenty years ago, Compu-Links began with an epiphany: the digital revolution was enabling dozens of opportunities to automate information in the property sector. \u00a0Our team would build an environment for information engineers who could leverage this technology to innovate, automate<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.compu-links.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/217"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.compu-links.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.compu-links.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.compu-links.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.compu-links.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=217"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.compu-links.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/217\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":256,"href":"https:\/\/www.compu-links.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/217\/revisions\/256"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.compu-links.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=217"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
